# When-Was-the-Golden-Era-of-Video-Games

# Overview

This project investigates whether there was a “golden age” of video games by analysing user and critic ratings alongside game sales data. The analysis draws upon a dataset of the top 400 video games released since 1977, aiming to identify the years that were most beloved by players and critics, while also exploring the commercial side of gaming.

# Objectives

- To determine if there exists a specific period widely considered the golden age of video games.
- To analyse the correlation between game ratings (user and critic) and their commercial success.
- To identify the most impactful years for video game releases in terms of quantity and quality.
- To draw insights into how game quality has evolved over time.

# Data Source

- Data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes information on video game titles, platforms, publishers, developers, sales figures, and Metacritic scores.

# Tools Used

- SQL for querying datasets
- Datalab for data analysis

# Insights

- Peak years such as 1998, 2004, and 2008 stood out for their high critic and user ratings.
- Critic and user scores both indicate a strong reception for games released in the late 1990s to mid-2000s.
- A small number of publishers dominated top-performing games, with Nintendo appearing frequently among the most successful titles.
- Games such as Wii Sports, Minecraft, and Super Mario Bros. were not only commercially successful but also highly rated.

# Key Findings

- 1998 emerged as a potential golden year, with the highest average critic rating of 9.32.
- The mid-2000s showed a balance between high release volumes and strong ratings, supporting the hypothesis of a golden era during this time.
- High game sales did not always correlate with the highest ratings, suggesting that commercial success and critical acclaim are not always aligned.

# Recommendations
- Game developers should study the design, marketing, and storytelling elements of top-rated games from the late 1990s and early 2000s to inform modern game development.
- Publishers can leverage nostalgic trends by remastering or reintroducing games from this era.
- Further research should be done using the full dataset of 13,000+ games for more comprehensive conclusions.
